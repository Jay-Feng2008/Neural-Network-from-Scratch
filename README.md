# Neural-Network-from-Scratch
A neural network built entirely with basic math functions in c++ that distinguish circles and rectangles    
# Explanation     
In normal circumstances, the step activation function choosed for a neural network is either sigmoid or tanh shown in the equations below

For each individual activation functon, there has to be a corresponding function for updating weights.
In most networks, the function for updating the weight is shown below
